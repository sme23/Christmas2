Raven hated Christmas![N]

The whole Christmas season![A][N]

Now, please don't ask why.[N]

No one quite knows the reason.[A][N]

It could be, his family[N]

died when he was small.[A][N]

It could be, he never[N]

knew Christmas at all.[A]

But I think that the[N]

most likely reason of all[A][N]

may have been that his heart[N]

was two sizes too small.[A][X]
