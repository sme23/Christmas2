## OpeningText1
All the townsfolk in Ostia[N]
loved Christmas a lot,[A][N]
But Raven, who lived just[N]
outside of Ostia, did not.[A][X]

## OpeningText2
Raven hated Christmas![N]
The whole Christmas season![A][N]
Now, please don't ask why.[N]
No one quite knows the reason.[A][N]
It could be, his family[N]
died when he was small.[A][N]
It could be, he never[N]
knew Christmas at all.[A][N]
But I think that the[N]
most likely reason of all[A][N]
may have been that his heart[N]
was two sizes too small.[A][X]

## OpeningText3
But, down in the town[N]
of Lycia's heart,[A][N]
The Marquees was giving[N]
the townsfolk a start.[A][X]

## OpeningText4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNormalHector]
Oho![A][X]

## OpeningText5
He cried out, a familiar sound,[A][X]

## OpeningText6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNormalHector]
My holiday outfit cannot be found![A][X]

## OpeningText7
During the Christmas[N]
of the year past,[A][N]
Hector was given an[N]
important task.[A][N]
He was tasked with delivering[N]
presents all night,[A][N]
So the children may wake[N]
with their feels of delight.[A][X]

## OpeningText81
Alongside him was[N]
his reliable crew,[A][N]
Lady Serra,[A][X]

## OpeningText82
And Sirs Oswin[A][X]

## OpeningText83
And Matthew.[A][X]

## OpeningText84
Together these four[N]
would deliver presents[A][N]
To all in Lycia,[N]
even the peasants.[A][X]

##OpeningText9
But little did they know[N]
that later that night,[A][N]
They would encounter[N]
a terrible sight...[A][X]

##OpeningText10
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMatthew]
[OpenMidRight][LoadHector]
What's all the commotion here about?[A][N]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRaven]

[OpenMidRight]
Good.[A][N]
Now that we've taken their gifts,[A][N]
their food,[A][N]
and their holiday cheer,[A][N]
it's time to burn what's left.[A][X]

##OpeningText12
[OpenMidRight][LoadHector]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSerra]
What!?[A][N]
They even stole our Christmas feast!?[A][N]
That's SO not fair![N]
I was looking forward to that![A]
[OpenMidRight]
We've got to give fresh[N]
gifts to everyone in Ostia,[A][N]
and take back what Raven stole![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Especially the food![A][X]
